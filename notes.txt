	 						size	mercury	sewage	radio	toxic	garbage
karachay			sm										yes
onondaga			s/m		yes			yes						yes
tai						m/l													yes?
serra palada	sm		yes
victoria			l							yes						yes		yes

fight waves of enemies on single board to purify lakes. day = your turn, night = enemy turn
- if you die, start again from same level?
- base attack = 3
- base AP = 3
- base HP = 9

enemies...
- will move OR attack on their turn
- spawn semi-frequently, sometimes multiples at once. almost every night adds a new enemy
  - different thresholds for different lakes? e.g. at most 3 enemies for lv1, at most 4 for lv2, etc
- come in a few varieties, but not many
  - garby: basic attacks & moves
	  - 6 HP, 1 attack
	- mercuri: acts twice but has low HP
	  - 4 HP, 1 attack
	- sewy: can't do special attack if adjacent
	  - 6 HP, 1 attack
	- plasty: high HP
	  - 10 HP
	- toxy: attacks at range
	  - 6 HP, 2 attack melee, 1 ranged?
	- algy: holds you in place if melee attack connects either way ("don't touch it!")
	  - 8 HP, 1 attack, or 2 if restrained?
	- pharma: heals other enemies on its turn (all +3 HP)
	  - 8 HP, 1 attack (but always heals if able)
	- nukey: self-destructs when killed
	  - 3 HP, 1 attack, 2 dmg for self-destruct
- drop rewards when defeated ("purified"), either HP bubbles or items (if flashing)

bosses... 1 for each stage?
- all:
  - only appear when all other enemies defeated, after minor fanfare
  - attack 3 times per turn?
	- have unique graphics
	- randomly summon HP bubbles so player can survive more easily? but only some
	- have fairly high HP
- invasive species: summons adds?
- noise pollution: strong, ranged attack?
- heat pollution: melee attack gets stronger over time? +1 every time it hits?
- light pollution
- pesticide: constant damage over time
- 1 of each normal enemy all at once?
- humans? summon garbage adds?

implement enemy syncs if time, but keep very basic. no scaling, maybe even all the same effect

moving and attacking cost 1AP each

move into enemy to melee attack

special does special attack
* call it "wish"?
x can use 3 times, get 1 use back per day
- can use 3 times, get uses back after collecting Special fish
- default: 3 random hits to any enemies, 3 damage
? augment: more damage
? augment: more hits from base effect?
- augment: also attacks adjacent enemies with strong hit
? augment: also attacks center with strong hit
- alligator: also heals 3 HP for every enemy defeated

pick up power-ups that passively enhance stats
- cattail: max HP + 1
- lotus: max HP + 2
? free moves at water's surface
- eel: phys attack + 1
- duck: phys attack + 2 at surface
- crab: phys attack + 2 at lake bottom
- more special attack uses stockable
- more special recharge fish
- toy boat: many more special recharge fish at surface
- sunken treasure: many more special recharge fish at bottom
- frog: more HP fish
- turtle: many more HP fish at surface
- crayfish: many more HP fish at bottom
- nessie: AP + 1
? heal more HP during the day (+1 on top of 3)
? HP bubbles heal 2x HP
? heal 3 HP after killing enemy

* picking up a 10th power-up when you already have 9 forces you to dump the oldest one? or opens a menu?
  * i think do if time, otherwise you just keep all powerups you find
* randomly given out in each stage

music should be easy: 1 for stages, 1 for bosses, 1 for menus/everything else

sfx will be a little harder. play for nearly everything!
