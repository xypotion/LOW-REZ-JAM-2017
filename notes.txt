Heart's Desire: Black Lake

5 levels? or 4?
	 						size	mercury	sewage	radio	toxic	garbage
karachay			sm										yes
onondaga			s/m		yes			yes						yes
tai						m/l													yes?
serra palada	sm		yes
victoria			l							yes						yes		yes

fight waves of enemies on single board to purify lakes. day = your turn, night = enemy turn
- if you die, start again from same level?

enemies...
- will move OR attack on their turn
- spawn semi-frequently, sometimes multiples at once. almost every night adds a new enemy
  - different thresholds for different lakes? e.g. at most 3 enemies for lv1, at most 4 for lv2, etc
- come in a few varieties, but not many
  - garby: basic attacks & moves? or restrains you?
	- mercury/hermy/mercuri: moves quickly & for free? or just acts twice?
	- sewy: high HP
	- toxy: holds you in place? or does DoT without moving
	- algy: holds you in place?
	- pharma: heals other enemies
	- radioactive/nukey: self-destructs when killed
- drop rewards when defeated ("purified"), either HP bubbles or items (if flashing)

bosses... 1 for each stage?
- all:
  - only appear when all other enemies defeated, after minor fanfare
  - attack 3 times per turn?
	- have unique graphics
	- randomly summon HP bubbles so player can survive more easily? but only some
	- have fairly high HP
- invasive species
- noise pollution
- heat pollution: strong attack at range?
- light pollution
- pesticide: constant damage over time
- humans? summon garbage adds?

implement enemy syncs if time, but keep very basic. no scaling, maybe even all the same effect

moving and attacking cost 1AP each

move into enemy to melee attack

special does special attack
- can use 3 times, get 1 use back per day
- default: 3 random hits to any enemies
- augment: more damage
- augment: more hits?
- augment: also attacks adjacent with strong hit
- augment: also attacks center with strong hit
- augment: 

pick up power-ups that passively enhance stats
- free moves at water's surface
- phys attack + 2
- phys attack + 3 at surface
- phys attack + 3 at lake bottom
- more special attack uses total
- 3 free moves each turn
- AP + 1
- heal more HP during the day (+1 on top of 3)
- max HP + 3
- HP bubbles heal 2x HP
* picking up a 10th power-up when you already have 9 forces you to dump the oldest one? or opens a menu?
  * i think do if time, otherwise you just keep all powerups you find
* randomly given out in each stage

music should be easy: 1 for stages, 1 for bosses, 1 for menus/everything else

sfx will be a little harder. play for nearly everything!
